# Lab | Random Forests

For this lab, you will be using the CSV files provided in the `files_for_lab` folder.

### Instructions

- Apply the Random Forests algorithm but this time only by upscaling the data.
- Discuss the output and its impact in the bussiness scenario. Is the cost of a false positive equals to the cost of the false negative? 
- Sklearn classification models are trained to maximize the accuracy. However, another error metric will be more relevant here. Please checkout
[make_scorer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html#sklearn.metrics.make_scorer) alogside with [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) in order to train the model to maximize a different error metrics than the accuracy.
